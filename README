Creating a Docker environment to run under Windows

Uses VirtualBox and Vagrant to pull and run Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (Trusty)

To Use:

Install VirtualBox and Vagrant.
Do a Git checkout of this repo.

Run `vagrant up`
Once Vagrant has pulled the ubuntu image and installed run:
	'vagrant ssh' 

This should get you to a prompt.

Next install Docker on the VM.

    3  sudo apt-get install docker.io
    4  sudo ln -sf /usr/bin/docker.io /usr/local/bin/docker
    5  sudo sed -i '$acomplete -F _docker docker' /etc/bash_completion.d/docker.io
    6  sudo docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash

If step 6 is successful, you're ready to pull your Docker image, etc...

**To Go**
- Figure out how to either: 
  a) add the Docker update to the downloaded Ubuntu image after it's downloaded. (in the Vagrantfile?)
  b) create a VM image with Docker already installed and create a repo.
